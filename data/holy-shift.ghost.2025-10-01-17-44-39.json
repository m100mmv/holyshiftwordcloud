I went well prepared after he suggested the topics for conversation in advance. We went through the competencies framework, (G.6) we were both surprised/encouraged by the evidence against most. There was some conversation about my ‘tigger’ like mood. That’s not to say lots ofHoly ShiftMattSuperintendent Prep, Training Options, MargieI prepped for a meeting with the Circuit’s Superintendent this week.

She'll be there on Sunday too...I was gifted the most incredible NIV concordance. It’s utterly addictive - even from a very basic ‘I wonder how many times word X appears...’ It’s become the new coffee-table book. If it were any bigger and had legs it could become a coffee table, it’s massive!\n\nI told LRGM the word 'no' appears over 1700 times in the NIV; she doesn't need to start every sentence with it!\n\nA rather engineered afternoon tea in the yard with Margie’s mum yesterday afternoon and she’s now fully up to speed; as predicted she wasn’t surprised but she will reflect deeply and ask questions as they arise. There will be plenty. It’s comforting to think she will be praying both for clarity and support.\n\nNighttime sermon writing for Palm Sunday at Stricklandgate. I’m pleased with the outcome. I had a run through with Margie, including a play through of the hymns to ensure flow. I cracked and had tears and Margie wobbled. Probably a good sign of a strong and hopeful message. I am struck by the paradoxical nature of the events building up to Holy Week. The celebration of Passover whilst under Roman occupation. The cheering of the crowds welcoming Jesus into Jerusalem only for those cheers to change to cries of “crucify him”. The interaction of the Pharisees with Jesus, and his assured, snappy response! Like my sermon on the first Sunday of Lent, there is a certain ‘punch’ to this one as we march into Holy Week.\n\nI’ve sensed, and it’s been suggested that, a ‘trad’ service will be welcomed.

Someone, forthright and unfiltered, launched into a fairly dismissive critique of the work of the local mission community - casually dropped into conversation as if they were commenting on the weather.\n\nI wasn’t offended. Just… confused...\n\nEcumenism at this level doesn’t suit everyone. I understand that. In fact, perhaps that’s part of the reason it needs a name. If it came naturally, it would simply be church, or worship, or our faith—something we didn’t need to label. But still, there’s a time and a place for expressing concerns. For asking questions, for being heard. This wasn’t it. And in truth, it wasn’t healthy or helpful.\n\nI felt oddly fine myself—thick-skinned, maybe—but aware that others might have felt second-hand discomfort. That quiet sort of embarrassment people feel for someone else’s sake. Strange sensation, really.\n\nWhat stayed with me was how far the view expressed seemed from what I felt to be true. And that’s what made it a little more than just an awkward moment. There was a visiting vicar present—someone I’ve met a few times before. I might drop her a line, just to offer a different, more hopeful account of good work in mission community. Not to rebut or challenge, but to share a fuller picture. A small rebalancing, perhaps.\n\nIt was also a lovely party.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1530103862676-de8c9debad1d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHBhcnR5fGVufDB8fHx8MTc0NDgzNjIyNXww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"members","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-04-16T20:42:18.000Z","updated_at":"2025-06-10T20:03:01.000Z","published_at":"2025-04-12T22:15:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"68001d6166236e0001db5495","uuid":"f7394fd5-226f-436c-a71f-9dffa29c3624","title":"Thanksgiving, Partnerships, Stations of The Cross","slug":"thanksgiving-partnerships-stations-of-the-cross","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"A service of thanksgiving this evening to mark the 50th anniversary of the Church Sharing Agreement between the Anglicans and Catholics and their joint use of the building.

I’m not sure I’ve ever actually been before.\n\nThe Methodist Church had its doors wide open, which felt like an invitation. I stepped inside… and straight into the middle of their weekly yoga class. I backed out as quietly as I could, largely unnoticed, and with absolutely no interest in observing, let alone attempting the lotus position.\n\nIn the porch, I spent some time reading their redevelopment plans—ambitious, detailed, and clearly the result of a lot of effort. The fundraising targets alone were enough to make me pause. The building has real potential. So does the cost...\n\nI have been particularly moved over the last few days of stripped altars, or the absence of The Cross; a striking reminder of what it all means. The one at Grange, a permanent feature I think, is as naked and raw as it could be: One Cross. Three Nails.\n\nI’d parked near the Anglican church and wandered in there too. It must have one of the most peaceful, picturesque settings and incredible outlook. I sat for a while and had a browse of their books. After about twenty minutes, I had a conversation with a very gentle man who turned out to be the church treasurer. He was delighted about the appointment of a new permanent vicar. It turned out he’d once lived in Seaford, so we ended up swapping stories about jumping off the point, steep pebble beaches, and walking the Seven Sisters.

It was that impactful.\n\nSo in no particular order, and with no weight applied to any individual statement (except perhaps the last one), here are my captured thoughts as the retreat went on:\n\nThe retreat exemplified the rich tapestry of God’s creation. All attendees, meeting together, stitched together like a beautiful tapestry, with our rich stories, and journeys, at the same place, discerning their call from God.\n\nI genuinely felt this next statement; especially following extensive small group work:\n\nWhen we're stripped bare, leaving baggage behind, allowing God in, only then does the armour of God fit properly.\n\nOtherwise it's like putting a jumper on top of a jumper - it doesn't feel right.\n\nThis article was a find following a conversation with one of the authors (and one of the retreat team), this is the most recent of his publications.\n\nJustice in Methodist HymnodyThe Report to the 2023 British Methodist Conference, A justice-seeking Church<xref ref-type=“fn”…SciendoMichael J. A. Long\n\nThe same author, as President of Conference, delivered his inaugural address on Social Holiness - if that phrase doesn't feature in my next Sermon I'll be astounded.\n\nThe theories and concepts capture almost everything the church should be, in 2025.\n\nEphesians 4:22–32 NIV - You were taught, with… | BibliaYou were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be…Biblia\n\nGod isn’t elsewhere.\n\nI prayed this, repeatedly, and have continued to do so.\n\nWhat am I about to take my family through?\n\nThis question featured as the main topic of conversation during a 1:1 with a lay member of the retreat team. She is married to a Methodist minister. Our shared reflections and silent, radiating prayers, will be with me forever.\n\nThis is Christ's body, broken...for you.\n\nI'd maintained emotional composure throughout the retreat. Hearing so many journeys of faith, witnessing God's call upon so many, and the assurance and affirmation shared amongst so many was moving (of course it was!) but nothing moved me like this moment: It was our final act of worship as a group, I observed others going for Communion, my turn...in that moment when the bread was given to me, the presiding ministers' eyes and mine locked, my upturned palm remained in place as did his hand and the bread for a fraction longer than it needed to. I've used the word tangible before to describe moments of the Holy Spirit at work. This was, without doubt, the most tangible and physically evidenced expression of what that means.\n\nI was able to be me\n\n9 of us were billeted or as it became quickly referred to 'in exile' at the local Premier Inn because the retreat venue didn't have enough rooms for the first night (what a superb problem to have), technical issues meant we weren't able to check-in upon arrival and some gentle organising was needed to ensure we got it resolved - I was able to be me. I engaged with the staff at reception, when I say engaged we laughed and laughed, shared stories and enjoyed each other's company, (Anne needs a medal).\n\nI organised a table in the restaurant for others in exile to relax with some cold water...It was a hot, sticky afternoon and we were all keen to freshen up before heading to the main venue for registration and initial meetings. No one really needed the extra layers, and yet I felt very much at home just making sure folk were ok. I bagged myself a room upgrade 😆. Be kind.\n\n43 people attended the retreat, I have 15 pages of notes. I spoke to all but 4, circling the names of everyone I met and applying an old Housemaster's trick to remember something about them - each one was different and special. We were united in our love for Jesus and our sense of call to serve the Methodist Church. Wow.\n\nPeople didn't seem nervous but there were some who will have been very - the retreat team's ability to shift from stable, encouraging, affirming, challenging leading of retreat task to supporting some real moments of brokenness was inspirational. It was important that others recognised these moments too, treading gently. Respecting space and reading the room was very important.\n\nI had planned for the drive home (about 5 hours) to be an opportunity to reflect on everything that had gone on. Traffic was light(ish), reflection was hard - there was too much. I had shared how hard I have to work on inner stillness - bombing up the M6 is not conducive to achieving it.\n\nA mile from home I was the car following a head–on collision. Emergency services arranged, people checked, cars made safe...I then sat with a member from our church for an hour as she was cut free. She and her husband were taken to hospital. All will survive.\n\nThe retreat was sandwiched between moments of pastoral care; delivered in the most appropriate and people-focussed way that the situation demanded. It is fast becoming an expressible and lived-by cornerstone of my ministry (a rather bold statement). I am reminded of the time a boy was distraught by being unable to find a matching pair of socks. At that time, in that moment, it is all that mattered. (albeit briefly!).\n\nI was able to be me.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581964974650-250c3983a17b?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDM5fHx0YXBlc3RyeXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3NDgyNTEyMDV8MA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"members","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-05-26T09:18:55.000Z","updated_at":"2025-06-10T20:06:32.000Z","published_at":"2025-05-22T19:52:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"684425c0757e2600016029bc","uuid":"63faa13d-60af-4156-a817-9dcd4e3bc4a4","title":"The Advisory Panel","slug":"the-advisory-panel","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"I'm posting this after the last of the Advisory Panel Conversations.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Question: Do you know the best mind-mapping software?\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Answer: Are you a 17 year old preparing for his A Levels?\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"I can always rely on my colleagues to bring me back down to earth.

OK, erm...Writer’s block is definitely a ‘thing’. Overcoming the same when crafting a whole service and creating a portfolio...urgh.Holy ShiftMatt\n 1. Be creative; we want something a bit different.\n 2. Hands-on and practical.\n 3. Collaborative; all the people should be doing something or involved somehow.\n 4. There may be children; and they could range from 0-16.\n 5. It's assessed.\n\nOh, and it was only to be 45 minutes.\n\nI went for balance. The majority of the congregation get much from 'steady' well-known hymns, a clear, accessible message and something actionable and tangible for the week ahead. So I needed to weave this in as the dominant trait whilst also introducing things that cover 1-4. This is how it went...\n\nThey have done a café-style setup before. So I went for that. Tables, chairs (no coffee until afterwards).\n\nPuzzles and games of patience obtained. Each table had:\n\n * A Rubik's cube\n * A wire-game\n * A Jenga\n * An envelope that said 'do not open...yet'.\n\nPart 1: Some (too dark) AI generated images of my patience being tested. These needed to be more generic; perhaps more gentle.\n\nThe children up front to try the buzzy-wire-game. This felt a bit unneeded - everyone should have given this a go for a few minutes.\n\nSome prayers, a welcome and call to worship, a strong opening hymn (remembering balance).\n\nA whole-congregation attempt at some patience...x 2 of this. This was well recieved.\n\nPart 2:\n\nThe core message. Noticing inner-stillness in others, noticing patience as a fruit of the spirit I admire and want more of. Seeing Jesus in others and wanting more of it isn't coveting, it isn't envy or jealousy. It is growth. We grow in Him. We’re transformed through Him. And when we spot those Spirit-filled qualities in others we’re not supposed to be jealous. We’re supposed to let it point us back to the One who produces all those fruits.\n\nGalatians 5:22–25 NIV - But the fruit of the… | BibliaBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.

The adults in the congregation were poorly briefed by me, they looked at the items on the tables like museum pieces - I wanted them being used throughout.\n\nA nice song to break up the sections:\n\nPart 3: Wrap everything up. A few more images of things that test my patience. Again too dark, they were rushed and I hadn't quite thought through the congregations mind-set at that point.\n\nBut a good opportunity to share this - my solution to the Rubik's Cube:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:05\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrayers of intercession, hymns, offering, The Grace.

This is breathtaking...\n\nWhen Jesus heard that his friend Lazarus was dying, he delayed going back to Judea, because it was dangerous. The authorities were already plotting to kill him. The disciples were terrified. And yet Thomas was the one who spoke up and said, “Let us also go, that we may die with him”?\n\nJohn 11:16 NIV - Then Thomas (also known as… | BibliaThen Thomas (also known as Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”Biblia\n\nNot a doubter, more a companion ready to risk everything.\n\nLater, when Jesus tells them he’s going to prepare a place for them in his Father’s house, he says: “You know the way.”\n\nThe others stay silent, nod politely, maybe hoping someone else will ask the awkward question. It’s Thomas who dares to say, “Lord, we don’t know where you’re going. How can we know the way?”\n\nThomas, again, honest and brave enough to admit he doesn’t understand.\n\nJohn 14:1–5 NIV - “Do not let your hearts be… | Biblia“Do not let your hearts be troubled.

But when you look back, I mean really look back, it’s never been what it used to be.</p><p>Wesley didn’t plan a denomination, he didn't want to 'create' a church.

The intensive version takes place 14th-16th July as a residential (instead of 10/15 weeks online). The dates seem to fit really well with everything else. Let’s see what happens. Applying for the course I have realised my passport has run out!Holy ShiftMatt\n\nThe course, Ministry in the Methodist Tradition, was a tapestry of Church history, moments of revival, awkward transitions, messy people, and surprising grace.\n\nAndrew Stobart, the new Principal of the College, led the lectures; 10 sessions almost back to back and a group of 8 of us spent most of the three days on the edge of our seats. The standard of teaching was at a level I'd never experienced. Simply outstanding!\n\nA few observations I’ve brought back with me...\n\nWe’ve never stood still, even when it looks like we have. Even when it feels like nothing is happening God’s people have always been in motion and more often than not, that motion comes through moments we weren’t quite ready for.\n\nWe worry about structure, decline, change, tradition, and sometimes we think, “Well, things aren’t what they used to be”. But when you look back, I mean really look back, it’s never been what it used to be.\n\nWesley didn’t plan a denomination, he didn't want to 'create' a church. He didn’t design a movement from a whiteboard. He responded. He watched. He took risks, and often, he wasn’t even there when the key bits happened. Oversight was born from his absence. Churches were built when societies outgrew their structures.\n\nAnd to be honest, some of the most pivotal moments in the Church’s growth came when Wesley died.\n\nIt’s never really been about the founder, the system or the strategy. It’s about God at work; quietly, persistently, powerfully and people willing to say yes.\n\nThat’s what the Quiet Revival report last week reminded me of too:\n\nThe Quiet RevivalThis quiet revival isn’t just a statistic. It’s a movement of the Spirit. And each of us has a part to play.Holy ShiftMatt\n\nIt’s not about big movements or glossy branding.\n\nIt’s the young adult stepping into a church service they weren’t invited to, because something pulled them in..and on that note...\n\nBefore landing at Cliff, and by way of extreme contrasts, I had attended the Henley Festival. It was superb.\n\nIn conversation with people in their early twenties, it quickly became apparent that they had an interest, a real, tangible interest in exploring their faith, but hadn’t found the push to step into a church on a Sunday morning and experience that community and fellowship gifted by our time of worship.  They’ve now been encouraged to do so and I can't wait to hear how they got on. Sometimes, challenging apathy and giving confidence that 'all will be well', is enough.\n\nStraight after Henley, en-route to Cliff College, I stopped off at Chesterfield's Church of St Mary and All Saints, (Crooked Spire) Church. I arrived in time to join Morning Worship, I was the only one, and the presider didn't notice me so carried on without me, in the Lady Chapel. I thanked him afterwards, he replied \"you're welcome\". Love that.\n\nWhat's my takeaway from the week?\n\nIt’s the prayer said quietly over someone who isn’t sure if they believe, but feels something stir. It’s the invitation that was half-awkwardly given, but entirely Spirit-led.\n\nWe sometimes ask, “Where is God in all this?”\n\nThe answer is: probably somewhere we’re not looking.\n\n * We think revival is loud. But often, it’s patient.\n * We think church history is neat. But it’s rarely tidy.\n * We think faith is about certainty. But often, it’s about stepping out not knowing what comes next.\n\nCliff reminded me that we are part of a bigger, wilder story than we let ourselves believe.

They can allow for a richness of dialogue and an opportunity to listen.\n\nWe both agreed: those conversational prayers throughout the day, the ones in the car, walking to work (or on his tractor), in the middle of the day, in-between meetings, they can be just as holy as the ones in a pew with a prayer book.\n\nThen came Tuesday night. Or should I say Wednesday morning, 2am to 3am. Sleepless, wide awake, heart racing. Too much on my mind. So what did I do?\n\nI prayed my socks off. I prayed for everything: My family. My work. My Church. My calling. For people I’d only met once, for people I’ve known forever. For communities broken, and roofs broken.\n\nIt was like a prayer floodgate had opened. And then I spent most of yesterday feeling guilty.\n\nBecause I thought, wasn’t I the one saying God doesn’t need formal prayer slots? Wasn’t I the one who said the conversational stuff was enough?\n\nAnd now here I was, doing a 2am mini-retreat.\n\nTo cement this conflict, to deepen the contrast, I ended up at a BCP Holy Communion service this morning. You couldn’t get more formal. More structured. More crafted in its language and it was beautiful.\n\nGod was making a point.\n\nWhat became clear is that there is room for both.\n\nThere is room for the spontaneous sigh towards heaven and the carefully worded Collect. Room for the sleepy 2am outpouring and the service book handed down through generations.\n\nHe is in the casual “Help me, Lord” and the reverent “We do not presume to come…”\n\nHe is in the rhythm, and in the rupture of that rhythm.\n\nLord of rhythm and stillness,\nTeach us to trust the conversation we’re already having with You.\nLet us not measure our prayer life by its neatness or noise\nbut by the nearness of You in it all.\n\nMay we find You in the silence and the sleeplessness,\nin the Sunday service, the school run, and the rat race.\nin whispered fears and joyful thanks.\nAmen.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601735479770-bb5de9dbe844?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDExOXx8Ym90aHxlbnwwfHx8fDE3NTM2MjgzMDV8MA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"members","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-07-27T14:51:30.000Z","updated_at":"2025-07-27T15:02:03.000Z","published_at":"2025-07-24T19:59:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"The spontaneous sigh towards heaven and the carefully crafted liturgy.

But Lord, we confess that what begins as love for one’s country can too easily harden into superiority, prejudice, and even hatred. When national pride tips into nationalism, it blinds us to the humanity of others. It fuels bigotry and racism, and it builds walls where You call us to build bridges.\n\nWe pray for those who arrive among us with nothing but hope, those who leave behind homes, histories, and loved ones in search of safety. Too often they are met with suspicion or rejection, when what they long for is shelter and welcome. \n\nLord, forgive us when fear shapes our response instead of love. Break down the barriers of suspicion and hostility. Teach us to see every stranger as a neighbour, every neighbour as a brother or sister, and every brother and sister as a bearer of Your image. May Your Church lead the way in showing radical hospitality, generous compassion, and courageous love.”\n\nI wondered afterwards whether they were a bit close to the wire; whether they came across as more of a sermon than intercession. And maybe they did. But that’s because these really are concerns that sit heavily on my heart....\n\nPrayers aren’t always the right place to work these things through. And though I’ve been praying my socks off for a sense of calm surrounding this topic, I’ve turned to the gospel, and I’ve reflected.\n\nIn Luke’s Gospel, the Pharisees and scribes criticise Jesus:\n\nLuke 15:2 (NIV): 2 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”\n\nLuke 15:2 NIV - But the Pharisees and the… | BibliaBut the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”Biblia\n\nThis was a damning accusation. To eat with someone in that culture was to show acceptance, to join in fellowship, to share your table.\n\nJesus should, by their standards, have kept himself apart, guarded his reputation, and maintained the purity codes of his community. Instead, he deliberately crossed those boundaries.\n\nLuke goes on to describe how Jesus tells parables about the lost sheep and the lost coin. Both stories are outrageous in their own way; the shepherd leaving ninety-nine sheep unprotected for the sake of one, the woman turning her whole house upside down for a single coin. But that’s the point: the love of God is extravagant, excessive, reckless by the world’s standards.\n\nAnd that’s what radical hospitality looks like. It is not sensible. It is not cautious. It is not concerned with reputation. It risks the raised eyebrow, the criticism, the whisper of disapproval. Jesus made religious leaders deeply uncomfortable because he didn’t just preach about God’s mercy, he embodied it at the table; in real life, with real people.\n\nNow, if prayers on Sunday made those hearing them feel even a little uncomfortable, and I felt uncomfortable writing them because it made me reflect upon my own prejudices, then maybe that’s not such a bad thing. Discipleship is not about staying comfortable. It’s about being stretched into the likeness of Christ. And Christ calls us, no tells us, not to draw the circle tighter but to throw the doors wider.\n\nThe call of Jesus is as urgent as ever: welcome the stranger, stand with the vulnerable, rejoice over the lost being found. Not because it’s popular or easy, but because that’s exactly what God has done for us in Christ.\n\nRadical is the very shape of the Gospel, it’s not optional. It’s the Shepherd searching, the woman sweeping, the Father running to embrace the prodigal. It’s the Son of God sitting at the table with tax collectors and sinners, and with us.\n\nWe might ask ourselves who are the people that we find hardest to welcome, I watch the news in despair at the conflict in our streets and around our world. We clash with people we work with, socialise with, live with, pray with...and what might it look like if we opened the door anyway? If we ate with them, listened to them, and let God’s joy surprise us in the process?\n\nLoving but challenging God, You never promised us an easy road.\nYou told us to take up our cross, to love our enemies, to welcome the stranger, to forgive without counting the cost.\nThese are not comfortable commands.\nThey unsettle us, they stretch us, they call us beyond what feels safe.\nYet they are the way of life, the way of joy, the way of Christ. \nSo give us courage, Lord, to live with open hearts and open hands.\nWhen fear would have us turn inwards, teach us to turn outwards.\nWhen pride would make us exclude, teach us to embrace.\nWhen comfort would make us silent, teach us to speak and act for Your kingdom.\nFor You have welcomed us with radical grace. May we do the same.\n\nAmen.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517346665566-17b938c7f3ad?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDR8fGVtYnJhY2V8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzU3OTYyOTcyfDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"members","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2025-09-15T18:47:03.000Z","updated_at":"2025-09-29T12:07:19.000Z","published_at":"2025-09-11T19:04:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Like radical hospitality, the love of God is extravagant, excessive and reckless by our standards.
